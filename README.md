# heap-sort
* Sorting a list of numbers using heap sort algorithm </br>
- The heap.c file use a method for creating a heap function: </br>
time complexity of creating a heap in this method is: O(nlogn)</br>
and time complexity of heap sort is: O(2nlogn) so is O(nlogn)</br>
- The heapify.c file use heapify method to create a heap:</br>
time complexity of heapify method is O(n)</br>
and time complexity of heap sort is: O(2n) so is O(n)
